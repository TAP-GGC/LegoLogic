## :loudspeaker: About

This project utilizes LEGO SPIKE sets to create an interactive, educational experience aimed at teaching basic coding concepts through a hands-on workshop. Participants build and program a catapult on wheels to hit color-coded targets, simulating a carnival game. This engaging approach helps learners understand fundamental coding concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops. The primary target audience for this workshop is students with little to no programming knowledge or experience, providing them with an introduction to coding and robotics in a fun, interactive way.

## :bulb: Project Information

### üî∞ Difficulty Level
- **Beginner**

### üéØ Target Audience
- **6th Grade - College**

### ‚è≥ Duration of Workshop
- **60-90 minutes**

### üìã Needed Materials
- Computers with keyboards  
- Access to [spike.legoeducation.com](https://spike.legoeducation.com)  
- At least one LEGO Spike Prime set  

### üéì Learning Outcomes
The primary goal of this project is to teach students the essential concepts of **variables, conditionals,** and **loops** in computer coding, primarily using **LEGO Spike robotics** and **block coding**.

### üîß Technologies

- #### LEGO SPIKE Prime
**LEGO SPIKE Prime** sets are educational robotics kits that help teach students coding and engineering concepts. They combine programmable motors, sensors, and LEGO building elements to create interactive projects that develop problem-solving and computational thinking skills.  
[Learn more](https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-prime)

- #### LEGO SPIKE Software
The **LEGO SPIKE software** is a coding platform designed specifically for the SPIKE Prime sets. It uses a block-based coding interface that is intuitive for beginners, allowing them to program their robots. The software integrates with the SPIKE Prime hardware to enable hands-on learning of coding concepts like **loops, conditionals,** and **variables**.

## üìÑ Project Description

This project, designed for the **Technology Ambassadors Program (TAP)**, uses **LEGO SPIKE Prime** sets to create an interactive and educational workshop experience that introduces participants to fundamental coding concepts. 

### üöÄ Project Overview

The workshop revolves around building and programming a **catapult on wheels** that can hit **color-coded targets**, simulating a carnival game. This hands-on project helps participants grasp the basics of programming through a fun and engaging activity.

### üß© Sections of the Workshop

1. **Introduction to LEGO SPIKE Prime and Coding Basics**  
   The session begins with an introduction to the **LEGO SPIKE Prime** robotics kit, where participants learn about the different components such as motors, sensors, and building elements. The basics of the **SPIKE software** and its block-based coding interface will also be covered, providing participants with the foundational knowledge to get started.

2. **Building the Catapult on Wheels**  
   Participants will be guided step-by-step to construct a catapult using the LEGO SPIKE Prime set. During this section, they will learn how to assemble the components, such as motors for movement and sensors for detecting color-coded targets. This process will teach essential engineering skills like following instructions, troubleshooting mechanical issues, and understanding how different components work together.

3. **Programming the Catapult**  
   After constructing the catapult, participants will use the **LEGO SPIKE software** to program their creation. They will learn to use coding blocks to control the movement of the catapult, detect targets with color sensors, and launch the projectile at the correct moment. This segment introduces coding concepts such as **variables, conditionals,** and **loops** through hands-on practice, reinforcing the logic and structure behind each concept.

4. **Interactive Carnival Game Simulation**  
   With the catapults built and programmed, participants will test their creations by attempting to hit color-coded targets. This interactive game allows students to see their code in action, providing immediate feedback and opportunities for iteration. They will learn to adjust their code to improve accuracy, demonstrating the importance of debugging and refining programs.

5. **Reflection and Knowledge Sharing**  
   At the end of the workshop, participants will have the chance to share their experiences, discuss the challenges they faced, and reflect on the skills they learned. This section encourages critical thinking and communication skills while reinforcing the coding and engineering concepts covered in the session.
