## :loudspeaker: About

This project utilizes LEGO SPIKE sets to create an interactive, educational experience aimed at teaching basic coding concepts through a hands-on workshop. Participants build and program a catapult on wheels to hit color-coded targets, simulating a carnival game. This engaging approach helps learners understand fundamental coding concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops. The primary target audience for this workshop is students with little to no programming knowledge or experience, providing them with an introduction to coding and robotics in a fun, interactive way.

## :bulb: Project Information

### üî∞ Difficulty Level
- **Beginner**

### üéØ Target Audience
- **6th Grade - College**

### ‚è≥ Duration of Workshop
- **60-90 minutes**

### üìã Needed Materials
- Computers with keyboards  
- Access to [spike.legoeducation.com](https://spike.legoeducation.com)  
- At least one LEGO Spike Prime set  

### üéì Learning Outcomes
The primary goal of this project is to teach students the essential concepts of **variables, conditionals,** and **loops** in computer coding, primarily using **LEGO Spike robotics** and **block coding**.

### üîß Technologies

- #### LEGO SPIKE Prime
**LEGO SPIKE Prime** sets are educational robotics kits that help teach students coding and engineering concepts. They combine programmable motors, sensors, and LEGO building elements to create interactive projects that develop problem-solving and computational thinking skills.  
[Learn more](https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-prime)

- #### LEGO SPIKE Software
The **LEGO SPIKE software** is a coding platform designed specifically for the SPIKE Prime sets. It uses a block-based coding interface that is intuitive for beginners, allowing them to program their robots. The software integrates with the SPIKE Prime hardware to enable hands-on learning of coding concepts like **loops, conditionals,** and **variables**.

## üìÑ Project Description

### üöÄ Overview

The workshop revolves around building and programming a **catapult on wheels** that can hit **color-coded targets**, simulating a carnival game. This hands-on project helps participants grasp the basics of programming through a fun and engaging activity.

### üß© Sections of the Workshop

1. Introduction to LEGO SPIKE Prime and Coding Basics
   The session starts with an introduction to LEGO SPIKE Prime robotics, covering components like motors, sensors, and basic elements. Participants are introduced to the SPIKE software and its block-based     
   coding interface to set a foundation for the activities.

2. Programming the Catapult (Pre-Built)
   Participants jump into coding by using the central hub as a controller, learning variables and loops through hands-on practice. They then test their code with the catapult.

3. Programming the Button (Conditional Logic)
   In the next stage, participants code a button to trigger the catapult, introducing conditionals. After programming, they test the code to experience how the button functions.

4. Adding a Color Sensor (Conditional with If Statements)
   In the final coding segment, participants replace the button with a color sensor. They program the catapult to launch at different angles based on the sensor‚Äôs detected color, providing another example of   
   conditionals and if statements.

5. Interactive Target Practice and Reflection
   After testing, participants bring their catapults to the front to hit targets and play for a few minutes. The session concludes with a reflection, where participants share insights, discuss challenges, and   
   reinforce their learning on variables, loops, and conditionals.
